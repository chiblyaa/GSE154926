Project Description: We will use an unsupervised machine learning approach to identify subtypes of sjogren's syndrome (ss) based on their transcriptional profile. We will then generate a supervised model using Random Forest Classifiers (RFC) to predict subgroups of SS with the most significant featured identified in our unsupervised clustering approach.
