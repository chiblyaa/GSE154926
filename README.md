Project Description: We will use supervised machine learning approach to predict sjogren's syndrome (ss) based on the transcriptional profile of salivary glands. We will test the performance of 6 different algorithms including logistic regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Desicion Tree Classifier (DTC), Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), using a k-fold cross-validation approach. The algorithm with the highest accuracy to will be tested in the validation set to predict SS patients.
